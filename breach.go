	// be shown directly to end users (see the "Title" attribute instead)
	Name string `json:"Name"`

	// Title is a descriptive title for the breach suitable for displaying to end users. It's unique across

	// assets external systems may have for the site
	Domain string `json:"Domain"`

	// BreachDate is the date (with no time) the breach originally occurred on in ISO 8601 format. This is not
	// always accurate â€” frequently breaches are discovered and reported long after the original incident. Use
	// this attribute as a guide only

	// ModifiedDate is the date and time (precision to the minute) the breach was modified in ISO 8601 format.
	// This will only differ from the AddedDate attribute if other attributes represented here are changed or
	// data in the breach itself is changed (i.e. additional data is identified and loaded). It is always

	IsVerified bool `json:"IsVerified"`

	// IsFabricated indicates that the breach is considered fabricated. A fabricated breach is unlikely
	// to have been hacked from the indicated website and usually contains a large amount of manufactured
	// data. However, it still contains legitimate email addresses and asserts that the account owners
	// were compromised in the alleged breach
	IsFabricated bool `json:"IsFabricated"`

	// IsSensitive indicates if the breach is considered sensitive. The public API will not return any
	// accounts for a breach flagged as sensitive
	IsSensitive bool `json:"IsSensitive"`

	// will not be returned by the API
